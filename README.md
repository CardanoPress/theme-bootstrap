# CardanoPress Bootstrap Theme

For anyone wanting to have a clean starter theme that will work with the Cardano serialisation library and the
CardanoPress plugin. This is a perfect starting point for any dApp website integrating with Cardano.

## Installation
1) Download the theme from the repository here
2) From the admin area of WordPress, click Appearances > Themes
3) Click UPLOAD theme
4) Find the theme on your computer and upload it to your WordPress website
5) Enable and activate the theme

It is recommended that you now also create and configure a child theme to go along with this parent theme which will
contain all of your customisations for the websites styles.
